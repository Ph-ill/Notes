- ## Windows Tweaks & Utilities
	- ### [Microsoft Powertoys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)
		- it comes with a bunch of apps and tweaks that are all super well designed, there will be at least one you find useful and you can disable all the others
		-  now you have a 3d printer you'll for sure find the 3d file thumbnails feature useful
		-  it modifies explorer to show models like this

		- oh another thing powertoys adds that I find very very useful is powertoys run
		- You just press a hotkey in my case ctrl+space I think it defaults to alt+space and you get a text based launcher and you can use it to search for files, search for applications to run and I think even search google and do a couple of other things, run scripts etc.

	- ### [Tinkercad](https://tinkercad.com)
		- on that note to start making 3d models to print you'll want to look into tinkercad
		- super basic web based cad software, this will probably be the first thing you want to learn to use to create your own models
	- ### [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/)
		- and then when you're ready upgrade to the free version of this https://www.shapr3d.com/ 
		- the free version will likely have all the features you'll actually need to use
		- and it cloud stores your files for use on it's ipad and ios app versions so you can switch between them super easily
		- I use mine like this all the time ![[WhatsApp Image 2023-04-14 at 02.42.51.jpg]]
